  * A Second Course in Statistics: Regression Analysis, Seventh Edition, focuses on building linear statistical models and developing skills for implementing regression analysis in real situations. This text offers applications for engineering, sociology, psychology, science, and business. The authors use real data and scenarios extracted from news articles, journals, and actual consulting problems to show how to apply the concepts. In addition, seven case studies, now located throughout the text after applicable chapters, invite readers to focus on specific problems.
